<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
histories diverged from the current branch) into the current
branch.  This command is used by <em>git pull</em> to incorporate changes
from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes
from one branch into another.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
"<code>master</code>":</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then "<code>git merge topic</code>" will replay the changes made on the
<code>topic</code> branch since it diverged from <code>master</code> (i.e., <code>E</code>) until
its current commit (<code>C</code>) on top of <code>master</code>, and record the result
in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and
a log message from the user describing the changes.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>          A---B---C topic
         /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second syntax ("<code>git merge --abort</code>") can only be run after the
merge has resulted in conflicts. <em>git merge --abort</em> will abort the
merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However,
if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and
especially if those changes were further modified after the merge
was started), <em>git merge --abort</em> will in some cases be unable to
reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Running <em>git merge</em> with non-trivial uncommitted changes is
discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to
back out of in the case of a conflict.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The third syntax ("<code>git merge --continue</code>") can only be run after the
merge has resulted in conflicts.</p></div>

<p>
        Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
        be used to override --no-commit.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With --no-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating
a merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further
tweak the merge result before committing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and
therefore there is no way to stop those merges with --no-commit.
Thus, if you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated
by the merge command, use --no-ff with --no-commit.</p></div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
--edit

<dt class="hdlist1">
-e
</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">
--no-edit

<dd>
<p>
        Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to
        further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user
        can explain and justify the merge. The <code>--no-edit</code> option can be
        used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally
        discouraged).
The <code>--edit</code> (or <code>-e</code>) option is still useful if you are
giving a draft message with the <code>-m</code> option from the command line
and want to edit it in the editor.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the
user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor opened when
they run <code>git merge</code>. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the
updated behaviour, the environment variable <code>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</code> can be
set to <code>no</code> at the beginning of them.</p></div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up before
        committing. See <a href="https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html">git-commit(1)</a> for more details. In addition, if
        the <em>&lt;mode&gt;</em> is given a value of <code>scissors</code>, scissors will be appended
        to <code>MERGE_MSG</code> before being passed on to the commit machinery in the
        case of a merge conflict.

<dd>
<p>
        Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in history is
        already a descendant of the current history.  <code>--ff</code> is the
        default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag
        that is not stored in its natural place in the <code>refs/tags/</code>
        hierarchy, in which case <code>--no-ff</code> is assumed.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With <code>--ff</code>, when possible resolve the merge as a fast-forward (only
update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do not create a
merge commit).  When not possible (when the merged-in history is not a
descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With <code>--no-ff</code>, create a merge commit in all cases, even when the merge
could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With <code>--ff-only</code>, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when possible.
When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status.</p></div>

        GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The <code>keyid</code> argument is

        Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit
        log message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project,
        but it typically certifies that committer has
        the rights to submit this work under the same license and
        agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin
        (see <a href="http://developercertificate.org/">http://developercertificate.org/</a> for more information).

        Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
        happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually
        make a commit, move the <code>HEAD</code>, or record <code>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD</code>
        (to cause the next <code>git commit</code> command to create a merge
        commit).  This allows you to create a single commit on top of
        the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another
        branch (or more in case of an octopus).

good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if
there are conflicts.  See also <a href="https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html">git-stash(1)</a>.
<em>git pull</em> and <em>git merge</em> will stop without doing anything when
local uncommitted changes overlap with files that <em>git pull</em>/<em>git

<div class="paragraph"><p>To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit,
<em>git pull</em> and <em>git merge</em> will also abort if there are any changes
registered in the index relative to the <code>HEAD</code> commit.  (Special
narrow exceptions to this rule may exist depending on which merge
strategy is in use, but generally, the index must match HEAD.)</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_fast_forward_merge">FAST-FORWARD MERGE</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit.
This is the most common case especially when invoked from <em>git
pull</em>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed
no local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream
revision.  In this case, a new commit is not needed to store the
combined history; instead, the <code>HEAD</code> (along with the index) is
updated to point at the named commit, without creating an extra
merge commit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This behavior can be suppressed with the <code>--no-ff</code> option.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_true_merge">TRUE MERGE</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be
merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them
as its parents.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
merged is committed, and your <code>HEAD</code>, index, and working tree are
updated to it.  It is possible to have modifications in the working
tree as long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
happens:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The <code>HEAD</code> pointer stays the same.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> ref is set to point to the other branch head.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and
   in your working tree.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three
   versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor,
   stage 2 from <code>HEAD</code>, and stage 3 from <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> (you
   can inspect the stages with <code>git ls-files -u</code>).  The working
   tree files contain the result of the "merge" program; i.e. 3-way
   merge results with familiar conflict markers <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> <code>===</code> <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No other changes are made.  In particular, the local
   modifications you had before you started merge will stay the
   same and the index entries for them stay as they were,
   i.e. matching <code>HEAD</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="_merging_tag">MERGING TAG</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always
creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and
the commit message template is prepared with the tag message.
Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature check is reported
as a comment in the message template. See also <a href="https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html">git-tag(1)</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit
that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In such a case, you can "unwrap" the tag yourself before feeding it
to <code>git merge</code>, or pass <code>--ff-only</code> when you do not have any work on
your own. e.g.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">

<h2 id="_how_conflicts_are_presented">HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result
of the merge.  Among the changes made to the common ancestorâ€™s version,
non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file while the
other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the
final result verbatim.  When both sides made changes to the same area,
however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to
resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the "merge" program
from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.

Git makes conflict resolution easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.  The part before the <code>=======</code>
is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The default format does not show what the original said in the conflicting
area.  You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced with
Barbieâ€™s remark on your side.  The only thing you can tell is that your
side wants to say it is hard and youâ€™d prefer to go shopping, while the
other side wants to claim it is easy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An alternative style can be used by setting the "merge.conflictStyle"
configuration variable to "diff3".  In "diff3" style, the above conflict
may look like this:</p></div>

<h2 id="_how_to_resolve_conflicts">HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Decide not to merge.  The only clean-ups you need are to reset
   the index file to the <code>HEAD</code> commit to reverse 2. and to clean
   up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; <code>git merge --abort</code>
   can be used for this.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Resolve the conflicts.  Git will mark the conflicts in
   the working tree.  Edit the files into shape and
   <em>git add</em> them to the index.  Use <em>git commit</em> or
   <em>git merge --continue</em> to seal the deal. The latter command
   checks whether there is a (interrupted) merge in progress
   before calling <em>git commit</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Use a mergetool.  <code>git mergetool</code> to launch a graphical
   mergetool which will work you through the merge.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Look at the diffs.  <code>git diff</code> will show a three-way diff,
   highlighting changes from both the <code>HEAD</code> and <code>MERGE_HEAD</code>
   versions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Look at the diffs from each branch. <code>git log --merge -p &lt;path&gt;</code>
   will show diffs first for the <code>HEAD</code> version and then the
   <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> version.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Look at the originals.  <code>git show :1:filename</code> shows the
   common ancestor, <code>git show :2:filename</code> shows the <code>HEAD</code>
   version, and <code>git show :3:filename</code> shows the <code>MERGE_HEAD</code>
   version.

backend <em>merge strategies</em> to be chosen with <code>-s</code> option.  Some strategies
can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving <code>-X&lt;option&gt;</code>

        This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
        and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
        algorithm.  It tries to carefully detect criss-cross
        merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and
        fast.

<dd>
<p>
        This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
        algorithm.  When there is more than one common
        ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a
        merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
        the reference tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been
        reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
        causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits
        taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
        Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
        renames, but currently cannot make use of detected
        copies.  This is the default merge strategy when pulling
        or merging one branch.

        This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by
        favoring <em>our</em> version.  Changes from the other tree that do not
        conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result.
        For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This should not be confused with the <em>ours</em> merge strategy, which does not

        This option is a more advanced form of <em>subtree</em> strategy, where
        the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to

<dd>
<p>
        This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do
        a complex merge that needs manual resolution.  It is
        primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch
        heads together.  This is the default merge strategy when

<p>
        This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
        merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
        ignoring all changes from all other branches.  It is meant to
        be used to supersede old development history of side
        branches.  Note that this is different from the -Xours option to
        the <em>recursive</em> merge strategy.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
subtree
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and
        B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
        match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at
        the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common
        ancestor tree.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, <em>recursive</em>),
if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find
this behavior confusing.  It occurs because only the heads and the merge base
are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits.  The merge
algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no change at all, and
substitutes the changed version instead.</p></div>
